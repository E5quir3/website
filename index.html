<h1>Introduction To Us:</h1>
<p>We are a local based team of volunteers who devote our hearts and time to stray and poorly cats by rescuing, nurturing and rehoming them. </p>
<p> We formed Kitty Rescue Bury back in 2018 and have worked tirelessly ever since, with some amazing results to show for our efforts. </p>
<p> Unfortunately we often struggle financially when it comes to affording vet's bills, travel costs and food costs. And therefor regularly appeal for aid and also organise charity events to cover these outgoings.<p>
<p> We would like to show our gratitude to our benefactors and sponsers as we absolutely would not be able to achieve the results we have without their generousity.</p>
